Build 45
	* Added basic support for DVR streams. DVR failover won't work correctly if there are multipel origins that have versions of the same dvr stream

Build 44
	* Moved Executor to static field to reduce the number of thread pools that are created

Build 43
	* Added ip address lookup for origin serverListener so the origin will still answer requests if `wowzaSourceStreamHostName` property isn't set. `wowzaSourceStreamHostName` can still be used to override the default origin ip address

Build 42
	* Added support for mediaLists so that players are associated correctly with child streams
	* Improved mediaList detection to reduce the number of lookups when playing a mediaList stream
	* Improved loop workflow to further reduce the number of lookups

Build 41
	* Changed default protocol to wowz

Build 40
	* Modified url check to use regex instead of a series of indexOf checks
	* Added logging for error parsing response from origin
	* Fixed typos in some comments and removed old commented out code

Build 39
	* Fixed bug where url check was returning the wrong value

Build 38
	* Fixed bug in ModuleStreamResolver where returned domain name was being mistaken for the protocol if it starts with `wowz` or `rtmp`

Build 37
	* Updated ModuleStreamResolver to check if the name passed to resolveStreamAlias is already a Url

Build 36
	* Modified ModuleStreamResolver to shutdown the mediaCaster once its url i skull so we donâ€™t need to wait for it to time out

Build 35
	* Added extra debug logging around locks

Build 34
	* Fixed NPE in resolvePlayAlias method when checkAvailability was called with a  phantom session
	* Set clientRemoveTime when resolvePlayAlias is going to return null

Build 33
	* Another re-write of ModuleStreamResolver to try to fix reconnection problem
	* Updated UDPServer to check if the application is loaded before checking for stream (prevents it from inadvertently being loaded)
	* Updated logging in UDPClient

Build 31
	* Updated Message format to send & receive JSON
	* Updated UDPClient to catch & log timeouts properly
	* Updated UDPServer to return JSON
	* Updated UDPServer to check for HTTP streams separate to RTMP streams
	* Rewrite of ModuleStreamResolver
		* Handle RTMP & HTTP streams separately
		* Shutdown current mediaCaster and disconnect all players when last source fails
		* Re-resolve sources when player reconnects after forced shutdown
	* NOTE: this version is not compatible with any previous versions and all servers must be updated.

Build 30
	* Working on getting resolver to retry after a failure

Build 29
	* Removed error logging (where not applicable) and added debug statement prior to file url printout.

Build 28
	* Updated module to fix situation where failed sources aren't removed from the mediaCaster urls

Build 27
	* Fixed logging to correctly check if logger is set to debug level

Build 25
	* Added debug property to control logging level. Debug logging is off by default. Add wowzaResolverDebugLog property to Application Properties to enable
	* Updated Server Listener logging to make repetitive logging statements debug level only. Debug logging is off by default. Add wowzaSourceStreamUDPListenerDebug property to Server Properties to enable

Build 22
	* Cleaned up unused imports

build 21
	* Reverted update to UDPClient allowing local port to be specified

Build 20
	* Added support to detect stream name prefixes so MediaLists work properly
	* Added support for variables when defining the origin hosts file path
	* Fixed problem where an error response wasn't being handled correctly
	* Updated UDPClient to allow the local port to be defined as well as the remote port.  Remote port can now be set along with the remote host name using host:port notation
	* Fixed a problem with UDPServer where the receive buffer wasn't getting cleared between requests and was causing incorrect stream name lookups on some requests

Build 19
	* Updated UDP servers to correctly log remote connection details

Build 18
	* Added extra debug logging around the udp messages

Build 1
	* Initial commit
